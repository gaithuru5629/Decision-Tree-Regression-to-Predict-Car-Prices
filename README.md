# Decision-Tree-Regression-to-Predict-Car-Prices
Demo:
We will demonstrate the use of decision tree regression to predict the price of a car based on specified attributes.
In this case we will use the carbody, drivewheel, wheelbase, enginetype, cylindernumber, enginesize, horsepower and peakrpm.

Dataset: CarPrice.csv    
Library: scikitlearn, matplotlib

Homework:
Carry out the following decision tree implementation to predict house prices by filling in the blank cells in the provided

Jupyter notebook: DecisionTreeRegression_Group4_Homework_Question_1.ipynb.
